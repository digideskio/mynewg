Hello Admin,

The recurring payment for <%= @user.name %> has been unsuccessful. Here are the following details:

Date: <%= @notification.billing_date %>
Package: <%= @price.package.name %>
Price: <%= @price.value %>

This package price is charged every <%= @price.interval %> days.

We will try to arrange payment again for the user in 3 days, if this does not succeed, the user's account will be frozen until full payment is completed.

Regards
